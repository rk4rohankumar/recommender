Based on the outlined structure and requirements, here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

Core Classes:
1. DataGenerator: Generates synthetic user interactions using the Faker library.
2. KafkaProducer: Configures and produces real-time clickstream data using Apache Kafka.
3. KafkaConsumer: Configures and consumes real-time clickstream data using Apache Kafka.
4. CollaborativeFiltering: Implements collaborative filtering using Surprise library.
5. MatrixFactorization: Implements matrix factorization using scikit-learn.

Core Functions/Methods:
1. generate_synthetic_data(): Generates synthetic user interactions and saves them as a CSV file.
2. create_sqlite_database(): Creates an SQLite database and imports the synthetic data.
3. configure_kafka_producer(): Configures the Kafka producer to produce clickstream data.
4. configure_kafka_consumer(): Configures the Kafka consumer to consume clickstream data.
5. load_data_surprise(): Loads data from the SQLite database using Surprise's Dataset and Reader classes.
6. split_data_train_test(): Splits the data into training and testing sets.
7. train_collaborative_filtering_model(): Trains the collaborative filtering model using Surprise's SVD algorithm.
8. evaluate_model_performance(): Evaluates the performance of the collaborative filtering model.
9. retrieve_user_interaction_data(): Retrieves user interaction data from the SQLite database.
10. create_user_product_matrix(): Creates the user-product interaction matrix.
11. preprocess_matrix(): Preprocesses the user-product interaction matrix.
12. perform_matrix_factorization(): Performs Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) using scikit-learn.
13. get_collaborative_recommendations(): Generates collaborative filtering recommendations based on user interaction history and model predictions.
14. get_matrix_factorization_recommendations(): Generates matrix factorization recommendations based on user and product latent factors.

Now, let's proceed with creating the necessary files and implementing the code.
